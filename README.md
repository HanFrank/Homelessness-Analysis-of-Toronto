Author: Ziyao (Frank) Han

Abstract: "A well functioning shelter system and its accompanying services should be an essential part of the nervous system of a well-run city. This report uses data collected from Open Data Toronto and applies statistical visualization, past and present literature to analyse the homelessness situation in Toronto. The data shows that COVID-19 has had a significant impact on shelter usage and is a predominant factor in shelter usage and the homelessness situation in Toronto within the last two years. This report uses a range of data to analyse the shelter system to provide insight into the ongoing fight against homelessness."
